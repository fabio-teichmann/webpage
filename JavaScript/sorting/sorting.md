# Sorting

- critical for big inputs / large datasets
- sorting can become very expensive

## Issues with `sort()`

- JS sort converts numbers to string
- does not recognize charaters in other languages per se
- time and space complexity cannot be guaranteed (depends on implementation / browser)
- JS sort accepts function to adjust sorting logic

## Bubble sort (elementary sort)

- bubbling up numbers
- compares 2 adjacent numbers at a time
- one of the least efficient

## Selection sort (elementary)

- scan list for smallest item
- excahnge item with first item

## Merge sort (complex sort)
